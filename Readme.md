This project is based on my frustration for not being able to find anime based on specific criteria. While sites like MyAnimeList and AniList offer some filtering options, they often fall short when it comes to more complex queries. For instance, finding anime that are action-packed, have a high score, and were released in a specific year can be quite challenging. Also the search functionality on these platforms is often limited to exact matches, making it difficult to discover new titles based on partial information or specific themes.

To address these limitations, I developed a custom filtering engine that allows users to search for anime based on a wide range of criteria. This engine supports complex queries, including multiple filters that can be combined using AND/OR logic. It also includes a fuzzy search feature, enabling users to find titles even with partial or approximate information.
